# elmTodoMVC
I am trying to learn [elm-lang](http://elm-lang.org/). I could run through the examples on the elm site pretty fast. But struggled when I looked at advanced, higer-than-getting-started level of examples like [elm ToDOMVC](https://github.com/evancz/elm-todomvc). 

This is my attempt to breakdown and build TODO app ground up and learn the language by building.

Build using `elm-make Todo.elm --output=ToDoMVC.js`
